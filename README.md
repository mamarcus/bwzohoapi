# Brightway Zoho Integration via REST API
This repo will host both code and documentation of Brightway integration with the  low-code app platform Zoho via REST API
The integration modules within Zoho covers both Zoho CRM and Zoho CREATOR.
A presentation of this could be found in https://2021.brightcon.link/

## TO DO
- Automation of authtoken generation and authorization via Python SDK (See 
- Integration schema with Zoho as client and Brightway hosted in a server either with Django/ Flask via brightway api
- Integration by a series of webhook calls
- Extending the scope for implementation in other open source low-cede frameworks - jampy, budibase, corteza etc (to figure out the best possible one)
- zero knowledge encryption implementation
