# Brightway Zoho Integration via REST API
This repo will host both code and documentation of Brightway integration with the  low-code app platform Zoho via REST API.
The integration module covers both Zoho CRM and Zoho CREATOR.
A presentation of this could be found in https://2021.brightcon.link/

## TO DO
- Automation of authtoken generation and authorization via Python SDK
- Integration schema with Zoho as client and Brightway hosted in a server either with Django/ Flask via brightway api
- Integration by a series of webhook calls
- Extending the scope for implementation in other open source low-code frameworks - Jampy, Budibase, Corteza etc (to figure out the best possible one)
- Zero knowledge encryption implementation
